I’ve attached the AMI music generation code below. 

Take a look at “test_fastmidi.py” to see how I converted MIDI data to a list of music tokens.

“ami_prepare.py” prepares data for training.
“ami_train.py” trains a music generation model.
“ami_generate.py” generates new music using the trained model.
